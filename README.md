# captcha-recognition
This project investigates the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for captcha recognition and potential bypass (for educational purposes only). Captchas, short for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart," are security challenges designed to distinguish humans from automated bots.

### Project Goals:
* Develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model capable of accurately recognizing text within captchas.
* Explore different ML algorithms for optimal captcha recognition performance.

### Technologies Used:
* Python (main programming language)
* TensorFlow or PyTorch (deep learning frameworks) (**Specify which one you'll be using in the project**)
* OpenCV (computer vision library)
* pandas (data manipulation)
* matplotlib (visualization) (Optional)

### Dependencies:
The project relies on various libraries. Refer to the `requirements.txt` file for a comprehensive list of required libraries and their versions. 

### Getting Started:
**Prepare your dataset:**
You will need a dataset of captcha images with corresponding text labels. Several public datasets are available online for captcha recognition.

**Train the OCR model:**
The project code will likely include scripts for training the OCR model using your prepared dataset. Refer to the specific scripts and instructions within the codebase.

**Evaluate the model:**
Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy in recognizing captcha text.

### Contribution
We welcome contributions to this project! You can help by:

* Adding support for different captcha types.
* Implementing new ML algorithms for improved accuracy.
* Exploring ethical considerations related to captcha bypass techniques.

Please submit pull requests with clear documentation and explanations for your changes.
